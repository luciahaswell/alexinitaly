If you step just outside of the city too, you get amazing scenic views of the countryside, castles,museums, and of course the farms and production of the cheeses and meats. They say that this area is the best in the world for the curing and production of cheeses and meats because it has just the right amount of salinity and fog in the air. Parma also has incredible parks and shopping. Parma is home to Giuseppe Verdi and countless other famous artists/musicians/etc. ",
