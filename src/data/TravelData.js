They say that this area is the best in the world for the curing and production of cheeses and meats because it has just the right amount of salinity and fog in the air. Driving through the countryside you will find buildings with long narrow windows used for curing the meats and exposing them to just the right breeze. Parma also has incredible parks and shopping and is home to famous composer Giuseppe Verdi and countless other famous artists/musicians/etc. ",

We went to the center of the town one morning at 7 am and it was empty. We got amazing pictures and got to see some popular locations without fighting crowds. Most hotels will have transportation into the city centers so it’s not a problem. Staying in the outskirts of town also afforded the luxury of walking some less touristy areas and eating at less expensive and less busy restaurants with amazing food.

Until the 1950’s, many people in Matera still lived in the caves and did not have running water or plumbing until 1987 when Italian government came in and forced the cave occupants out of their cave dwellings and restructured the city and brought in aqueducts.

With that being said though, Sicily was important for me to see both personally and professionally because of my background in literature and my work with Roman and Greek Mythology. Sicily is a mystical land with so much natural beauty and delicious food. I will say Sicily is best done if you either 1) are young and have no children and can easily physically climb and move around the cliffs, etc. or 2) if you have a lot of money and can do the nice fancy beach hotels (think White Lotus) with a family. We found Sicily with a toddler a bit more challenging than other parts of Italy. The first thing to know about Sicily is how to get there from mainland Italy. This was the most chaotic part of our trip. We left Tropea and went down to Villa San Giovanni (the port in Reggio Calabria). I had pre-purchased tickets for us to put our car on the ferry, which leaves every 30 minutes all day, but somehow, in all the craziness, we were unable to get our ticket to work correctly and get validated. We finally found someone to help and we were able to get a new ticket and get our car on the ferry. Crossing over the strait of Messina was a dream because I have taught about this region of the world in The Odyssey for almost a decade. The strait of Messina is most known as the area where Odysseus fights off Scylla and Charybdis. There is even a city in Calabria called Scilla and the winds, everything about this place was mystical and eerie. It was a surreal experience.  But for anyone who wants to take this ferry and is not native to this area, be prepared for some chaos, even if you book ahead of time.",

Such a great place to relax and unwind but if you do not have a car, you cannot access this place. Also the further south that you move and the more you move into residential areas, the more you have to remember the “Pausa Pranzo” which is the couple of hours from about 2 or 3 PM- 5 or 6 PM where all local businesses are shut down and everyone is resting. So if you arrive around this time and expect to get lunch or site see, everything will be closed.",
